# Final Design Report Template

This report documents two full iterations of the design life cycle for our project. Each section outlines both our plans and the results from executing those plans. Answering the guiding questions in each section will help ensure that our design process is thorough and that we have strong justification for each design decision.

------

## 1. Introduction (5% – ~1 page)

**Purpose:** Provide an overview of the project, setting the context for the design challenge.

**Key Questions:**

- **What is the overall task or problem we are addressing?**
  (Describe the project objective and the user need or problem space.)
- **Who are the users, and what are they trying to accomplish?**
  (Detail the target audience and their goals.)
- **What specific user stories or vignettes inspired this project?**
  (Include any relevant anecdotes or scenarios that highlight the need for our solution.)

------

## 2. Needfinding Plan (5% – ~1 page + appendices)

**Purpose:** Outline your strategy for gathering initial insights about user needs through two distinct activities.

### Active Needfinding Activity

**Guiding Questions:**

  (Define the target demographics, number of participants, and recruitment strategy.)
- **How will we recruit them?**
  (Explain the channels or methods you’ll use to engage participants.)

  (Describe the planned activities: surveys, interviews, think-aloud studies, or apprenticeships, including key questions or tasks.)

### Heuristic Evaluation Activity

**Guiding Questions:**

- **Which existing interface will be evaluated?**
  (Specify the interface and why it’s relevant.)
- **What three (or more) heuristics will we use?**
  (List the chosen heuristics and explain their relevance, referencing sources like Nielsen’s heuristics or course materials.)

  (Detail instances where the interface adhered to or violated each heuristic.)
- **What specific issues or successes were identified?**

### Overall Insights

**Guiding Questions:**

- **What are at least three new insights about our user’s needs or behaviors?**
  (Link each insight to specific results or observations from the needfinding process.)
- **How do these insights inform our design direction going forward?**

------

## 4. Initial Brainstorming Plan (5% – ~0.5 page)

**Purpose:** Describe the approach to generating design ideas.

**Guiding Questions:**

- **What brainstorming methods will we use (individual, group, AI-assisted, etc.)?**
- **How will we mitigate known biases during brainstorming?**
  (Explain any strategies to ensure a diverse range of ideas.)
- **What are the specific design challenges or questions to be addressed during brainstorming?**

------

## 5. Brainstorming Results (5% – ~1.5 pages + appendices)

**Purpose:** Summarize the ideas generated and select design alternatives for prototyping.

**Guiding Questions:**

- **What ideas and design alternatives were generated?**
- **Which three design alternatives were selected for further development and why?**
  (Provide justification based on the needfinding insights.)
- **For each selected alternative, what is the initial textual prototype?**
  (Include a brief description that outlines its core features and design rationale.)

------

## 6. Initial Prototyping (10% – ~3 pages + appendices)

**Purpose:** Develop low-fidelity prototypes for the three selected design alternatives.

**For Each Prototype:** **Guiding Questions:**

- **What is the prototype and how is it constructed?**
  (Describe whether it’s a paper sketch, card prototype, storyboard, or another form.)
- **What design rationale underpins this prototype?**
  (Explain how it addresses the user needs and insights identified earlier.)
- **What visual evidence can we provide?**
  (Include at least one image per prototype.)
- **What are the strengths and potential weaknesses of this prototype?**

------

## 7. Evaluation Planning (First Iteration) (5% – ~1 page + appendices)

**Purpose:** Plan the evaluation of your three prototypes using both quantitative and qualitative methods.

**Guiding Questions:**

- **Who will be the evaluation participants?**
  (Define the target group, recruitment strategy, and any incentives.)
- **What tasks or interactions will the participants perform?**
- **What specific quantitative measures will be collected?**
  (Examples: task completion time, error counts, user ratings.)
- **What qualitative feedback will be gathered?**
  (Examples: open-ended responses, observational notes.)
- **How will we analyze both quantitative and qualitative data?**
  (Detail the statistical tests or descriptive methods to be applied.)

------

## 8. Evaluation Results (First Iteration) (10% – ~2 pages + appendices)

**Purpose:** Present and analyze the results from the evaluation of the prototypes.

**Guiding Questions:**

- **How many participants completed the evaluation, and how were they recruited?**
- **What quantitative results were observed?**
  (Include any statistical analyses, p-values, or other metrics.)
- **What qualitative insights were gathered?**
  (Summarize user feedback and behavioral observations.)
- **How do these results compare with our initial expectations?**
- **What implications do these results have for our next iteration?**

------

## 9. Second Iteration Planning (5% – ~2 pages)

**Purpose:** Use the first iteration’s evaluation results to plan the next phase of the design cycle.

**Guiding Questions:**

- **What new insights emerged from the first iteration evaluation?**
- **Which additional needfinding activities (if any) are required?**
- **How will these insights influence further design modifications?**
- **Will we refine a single prototype, or combine elements from multiple alternatives?**
- **What specific questions will drive the next iteration’s design process?**

------

## 10. Final Prototype (15% – ~3 pages + appendices)

**Purpose:** Develop a medium-fidelity prototype that embodies the improvements identified during evaluation.
